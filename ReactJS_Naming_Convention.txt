ReactJS Naming Conventions And some important points:

These points are already involved in Documentation provided in this project;

1.
** -->Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names. *****For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.

2.
*Always start component names with a capital letter.****** *React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example,
*represents an HTML div tag, but represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
